## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Auth must come first because billing, rate limiting, and usage tracking all depend on customer identity
- Stripe metered billing split from tier enforcement (Phases 2 and 3) because SDK upgrade + metering is distinct from business logic
- x402 is independent payment path (Phase 5), not gated behind Stripe completion
- Batch endpoint (Phase 6) is its own phase due to discount metering complexity

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- npm token expired (E401) -- browser login required before Phase 7
- ClawHub CLI not authenticated -- browser login required before Phase 8
- x402 V2 is new -- monitor @x402/core for breaking changes during Phase 5
- Stripe machine payments preview access may need Dashboard verification
